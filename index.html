                <h1>Front-End Developer</h1>
                <h2>2020 - Recent</h2>
                <p>I have been a front-end developer since 2020 with approx 1 year of experience. I use many well known
                    and trusted technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, React.js
                    etc. But I am keen to learn a couple more technologies like VUE and Angular. Looking forward to
                    enrich my framework knowledge a bi more! </p>

                <h1>Back-End Developer</h1>
                <h2>2021-Recent</h2>
                <p>Unlike Front-end development I am quite new to the world of Back-end development also known as server
                    side development. For starting I've decided to learn MERN stack development first since It is one of
                    the most popular stack in the world right now. But I also have ambitions to learn Python and Django
                    after this.</p>
